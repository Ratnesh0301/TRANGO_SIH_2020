## **Seat Booking API** ##

When a user book his seat then the app will hit the url with transport id and transport type as input.
Then the Api will update the database with the request and change the no of seats vacant decremented by one.

The output will be the **Seat Booking Success** or **All Seats Are Booked Already**.
